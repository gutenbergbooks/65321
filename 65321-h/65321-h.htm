<p class="pcapc">ENTERING THE PARK: Entering Mesa Verde is a breathtaking experience. Spectacular views confront the visitor as
the road ascends for 5 miles to a high valley. This valley is an important activity center&mdash;the MORFIELD CAMPGROUND-VILLAGE
complex. Just off the entrance road are 500 individual and group campsites, a 1500 seat amphitheatre,
horseback riding and a shopping center. Approximately 10 miles past Morfield the road reaches another important
point of activity. The National Park Service has located there the NAVAJO HILL VISITOR CENTER. On the
gentle summit above the visitor center is the FAR VIEW MOTOR LODGE. On the road one mile south is Far View
Ruin, a large surface pueblo important to the interpretation of Mesa Verde. The final four miles of the road descend
gently through the forest to SPRUCE TREE, the Park Headquarters Area. The principal interpretative activity is here
overlooking Spruce Tree Ruin, the third largest and, perhaps, the best preserved of the classical pueblo cliff dwellings.</p>

<h3 id="c1">PLAN YOUR SIGHTSEEING</h3>
<p>In the Museum, at Park Headquarters, ranger-archaeologists are on duty to provide
maps and guide leaflets, and to advise how to make the best use of your available
time. You could spend a week in Mesa Verde&rsquo;s spectacular environment, seeing
something new every day and absorbing the fascinating story of 2,000 years of
pre-history of the Stone Age people who built these cliff cities. But if your time
is budgeted to only one day or less, the Museum Staff will help you plan your
sightseeing so as to see the more important ruins as a prelude to your next&mdash;and
longer&mdash;visit.</p>

<p>The main sightseeing drives are normally open from 7:00 a. m. to sundown. There are two
6-mile loops starting from the Spruce Tree Museum Area. Use your own car or join the
tour-guided sightseeing bus trips. When following the Ruins Road Drives, park your
car and walk to overlooks, viewpoints, and down trails to the major ruins where ranger-archaeologists
are stationed to explain all details.</p>

<h3 id="c3">ANCIENT HOUSES&mdash;SQUARE TOWER&mdash;SUN TEMPLE CIRCUIT</h3>
<p>Principal features of this very informative trip are: five groups of
mesa-top excavations showing the development sequence of prehistoric
dwellings; a spectacular close-up rim view of Square Tower,
the tallest cliff dwelling structure; rim views of many ruins; and
opportunity to climb to the top of Sun Temple. Three to four hours
should be allowed to absorb fully the facts interpreted by means of
viewfinders, labels, models and maps at various stopping points.</p>
<p>To enter this loop road you will bear right at the first junction
beyond the Spruce Tree Museum Park lot. Stops at the sign, &ldquo;Pit
Houses,&rdquo; and at four additional surface-ruin sites in the next two
miles, enable you to look into homes of the pueblo farmers dating
from 600 to approximately 1200 A.D. These exhibits warrant
more than superficial study.</p>
<p>You must not miss looking down on Square Tower Ruin. To
reach the viewpoint from which the photograph on <a href="#Page_7">page 7</a> was
taken, leave your car at designated parking space and follow a
200-yard mesa-top trail.</p>
<p>Allow ample time at Sun Point to enjoy the wide panorama
and a view of the greatest concentration of big ruins. From this
point be sure to note Mummy House clinging to the cliff below
Sun Temple, across Fewkes Canyon.</p>
<p>Just west of Sun Point the road parallels the south rim of
Fewkes Canyon, named for the famous archaeologist of the Smithsonian
Institution who directed the excavation and stabilization of
these big ruins between the years 1908 and 1922. Stop at nearby
rim viewpoints to look down on Oak Tree House, New Fire House
Ruin, and Fire Temple.</p>
<p>Climax of your trip will be the stop at Sun Temple where you
may climb to the top of the walls of this great structure that was
left uncompleted, at the time of the great drought of 1276-1298.</p>

<p>This majestic ruin, the greatest of all cliff dwellings, is not only an
architectural masterpiece, but also a remarkable historical record.
Preserved within its walls is a fascinating story of a primitive people
who learned to work, and build, and live together in harmony
and mutual interdependence while our own European ancestors
were struggling under the harsh yoke of feudalism. It is this inspiring
story that should be carried away as your principal memory
of Mesa Verde, rather than an impression of crumbling walls.</p>
<p>To carry you back through the ages, the National Park Service
stations knowledgeable archaeologists here to tell you how the
ancient people lived, to point out many significant details of their
environment, and to lead you as intimately as possible into the life
of this Stone Age community.</p>

<p class="pcap">LUNACHUKAI MTS. FROM PARK POINT (EL. 8,572) A VAST PANORAMA OPENS UP TO THE SOUTH AND WEST. THE LOVELY UNBROKEN FOREST-GREEN MESA-TOP, IN THE FOREGROUND, SUPPORTED AND PROTECTED THE CIVILIZED PEOPLE WHO ONCE LIVED HERE.</p>
</div>
<p>No trip to Mesa Verde National Park is complete without a visit
to Park Point Lookout, 8,572-foot summit on the north rim. You
must not miss the thrilling and inspiring full-circle panorama of
mountains, mesas, and wide reaches of desert.</p>
<p>In many ways, the section of the panorama pictured in the above
<a href="#fig25">sketch</a> is most significant: it looks southward and westward
into the vast distances of the Navajo and Ute Indian Reservation&mdash;the
&ldquo;Four-Corners Country,&rdquo; where sixty thousand Navajos
herd their sheep and live their primitive nomadic life.</p>
<p>The fire guard will point out to you the volcanic spire of Shiprock,
50 miles distant as the buzzard flies. He may also call your
attention to the notch just north of the huge bulk of The Sleeping
Ute, where the McElmo Canyon Road leads to Hovenweep Ruins&mdash;and
beyond, to the vast colorful Monument Valley. You will
certainly want him to identify the spectacular 14,000-foot peaks
of the northern and eastern skyline.</p>
<p>Overshadowed or concealed in all this vastness are many features
that determined the very lives of the people who once lived
here&mdash;factors that literally created their hospitable environment.
Earth movements in long-past geologic ages had raised the Mesa&rsquo;s
rocks from beneath the seas; other more violent displacements had
thrust up the high peaks of the San Juans and the La Platas to the
northeast and, in so doing, elevated and tilted our Mesa. The resulting
elevation&mdash;8,500 feet at the north, sloping down to 7,000
feet at the south&mdash;encouraged the slight margin of rainfall that
invited trees and all manner of plants and animals to form a natural
community that welcomed the first hunters and Stone Age settlers
when they arrived.</p>
<p>There is deep meaning in the lovely unbroken green mesa-top
forest you see spread out before you. Stop for a moment and picture
how nature has reclaimed the fields of corn and beans and squash
that lay hidden between pi&ntilde;on groves a thousand years ago&mdash;and
how the stream of human life is not lost, but persists through
the ages: in this case, in the pueblo dwellers who live today beyond
the mesas and distant mountains of the southern horizon.</p>

<p>The Mesa Verde story has all the elements of the most thrilling
&ldquo;Western:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scene 1. Father Escalante and his cavalcade of Spanish explorers
camped at the northeast edge of the Mesa on August 11,
1776&mdash;without even suspecting that its deep canyons hid ancient
stone cities.</p>
<p>Scene 2. Antonio Armijo, with his caballeros at nearby Mancos
Creek, on November 19, 1824, searching for a route from Santa
Fe to California.</p>
<p>Scene 3. Secret inroads of the Mountain Men&mdash;beaver trappers
who may have poached in this remote section of the southern Rockies
in the 1830&rsquo;s and 1840&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Scene 4. The hectic rush of the gold and silver prospectors of
the 50&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s into the nearby La Plata Diggings.</p>
<p>Scene 5. Arrival of the pioneer photographer, William Henry
Jackson, at the mines; his search for vaguely reported ruins&mdash;and
his discovery and first photograph of a Mesa Verde cliff dwelling,
Two Story House, on September 9, 1874.</p>
<p>Scene 6. The government survey party led by H. H. Holmes,
surveying the new West, the next year, and finding a large cliff
dwelling which he called Sixteen-Window House.</p>
<p>Scene 7. Pioneer ranchers settling in the Mancos Valley in
the 1870&rsquo;s and 1880&rsquo;s, especially the Wetherills who made friends
with the Utes, and were permitted to run their cattle on the forbidden
Mesa Verde.</p>
<p>Scene 8. In 1885, the coming of the first, and possibly the most
willful, young lady tourist, Virginia Donahoe, who was given protection
by the officers of the Indian fighting cavalry and advised to
&ldquo;go home&rdquo;; but, instead, stayed at the Wetherill ranch and went
hunting arrowheads and prehistoric pottery with the five Wetherill
boys&mdash;and returned the next summer to equip her own expedition
that penetrated Cliff Canyon and &ldquo;discovered Balcony House Ruin
on October 6, 1886.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scene 9. The friendly old Ute chief, Acowitz, enjoying the
Wetherills&rsquo; hospitality and telling them of &ldquo;Big Cities&rdquo; in Mesa
Verde&rsquo;s canyons.</p>
<p>Scene 10. Richard Wetherill and his cousin, Charley Mason,
searching for lost cattle on the Mesa&mdash;and their dramatic &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;
of Cliff Palace and Spruce Tree Ruins on December 18,
1888&mdash;and Square Tower Ruin the following day.</p>
<p>Scene 11. The local cowboys &ldquo;treasure hunting&rdquo; in cliff dwellings
during the next few years&mdash;permissible digging for relics
which were beautiful curiosities and sometimes saleable.</p>
<p>Scene 12. Systematic field investigations by Dr. F. H. Chapin,
W. R. Birdsall and Baron Gustaf Nordenskiold, whose scientific
reports of 1890-93 resulted in the dawning recognition of the scientific
importance of these ruins and buried artifacts.</p>
<p>Scene 13. The women of Colorado rallying to the standard
of their Cliff Dwellings Association, through the 1890&rsquo;s and early
1900&rsquo;s, for the establishment of a national park.</p>
<p>Scene 14. Many congressional postponements and final action
establishing Mesa Verde National Park on June 29, 1906.</p>
<p>Scene 15. Subsequent palaver and a treaty with the Utes to
rectify the boundaries and to get the big ruins into the Park&mdash;and
controversy with these recalcitrant neighbors that persists to
this day.</p>
<p>Scene 16. Dr. J. Walter Fewkes of the Smithsonian Institution
and a digging crew repairing Spruce Tree Ruin and stabilizing its
walls in 1908, and Cliff Palace during the following year, and most
of the other big ruins during the next thirteen years&mdash;stabilization
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
and research that continues today under the National Park Service,
assisted by the National Geographic Society.</p>
<p>Scene 17. George Mills surveying the &ldquo;carriage road&rdquo; to the
Mesa top which was painfully pioneered from 1907 to 1914.</p>
<p>Scene 18. Announcement: &ldquo;On May 23, 1921, Mr. Jesse Nusbaum
of Colorado, a young archaeologist of great experience and
reputation for successful work in the Southwest, was appointed&rdquo;
as Superintendent of Mesa Verde National Park.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">&#9733; &#9733; &#9733;</span></p>
<p>The new Superintendent&rsquo;s wide and practical experience enabled
him to lead the way in coordinating and directing many important
activities: overall plans for the general functional layout;
architectural plans; road construction; establishment of public
campgrounds; development of water supply and other facilities
needed by the vastly increased number of visitors who were beginning
to discover this fascinating, unique, and hitherto almost
unknown National Park.</p>
<p>Outstanding among the permanent achievements of this constructive
decade were the development of the Ranger Guide
Service made up for the most part of trained young archaeologists,
under the direction of a permanent naturalist-archaeologist; the
building and equipment of a museum from funds contributed by
public subscription; the establishment of evening campfire lectures,
and demonstrations by the Navajos of their tribal chants and dances&mdash;activities
that today form the pattern of the inspiring interpretive
program conducted here by the National Park Service.</p>

</div>
<p>Collaborating with the staff of the Mesa Verde Museum, the
artist has shown typical activities at 3:00 P.M. on a sunny autumn
afternoon in 1270 A.D.</p>
<p>In the left foreground an unmarried girl with butterfly hair-do
is husking corn of several colors and gossiping with a married
lady who has the matron&rsquo;s two rolls of hair behind her ears.
Three women in the painting wear the pueblo dress, while the
others have string aprons; both would have been used in the
summer. Nearby is a ladle and a corrugated pot&mdash;on the wall
top a Classic Mesa Verde mug and a decorated jar.</p>
<p>Between the girl and the wife fixing her husband&rsquo;s hair lies
a snare. Close to the couple are a bowl, a squash, a stone axe, and
a peculiar submarine-shaped jar.</p>
<p>Above the couple a dog barks at a youngster who has broken
a big jar. Two women are making pottery; behind them two
women replaster the lower room of a two-story house, on top of
which a man is pointing out to some children that the town crier
is making an announcement, and they should keep quiet. Two
priests, one with ceremonial kilt and evergreens, climb a one-pole
ladder.</p>
<p>Beneath the crier a woman closes the doorway of her house
with a stone slab, and below her on the near roof an old lady
keeps warm with a rabbit-skin blanket, while her daughter
grinds corn. In front of the house a woman, whose baby snoozes
in a wooden cradle, bakes blue corn meal &ldquo;pancakes&rdquo; on a hot
stone slab. The kiva door is closed with a mat, turkeys wander
about, and the woman in the right-hand corner, sitting on the
beautiful brown textile (to be seen in the Park Museum),
strings turquoise beads.</p>
<p>To the right, two bow-and-arrow-makers ridicule a returning
unsuccessful hunter, women bring water in jars from the spring,
and turkeys pick over the trash pile.</p>
<p>Visible in the painting are a round and a square tower, ten of
23 exceptionally small kivas which occur in the ruin, and rectangular
and T-doors. Beyond the square tower with its balcony,
people are finishing a third-story room.</p>
<p>Cliff Palace had 200 living rooms and sheltered perhaps
400 persons.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
